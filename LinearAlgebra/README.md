Linear Algebra Library

This is where we stored all the necessary data structures and functions for all the Linear Algebra methods that serves as the backbone of our project. Since quantum operations can be represented by matricies it was important that we had some form of Linear Algebra library to draw from in order to properly build a quantum emulator. We decided to develop our own for the sake of efficiency. 

  LinearAlgebra_Operations.cs: This is the class that is in charge of handling all basic and complex calculations on the matrices, from addition  
  and subtraction to tensor products and euclidian norms.

  LinearAlgebra_matrix.cs: This is the class that represents a mathematical matrix object. 

  LinearAlgebra_vector.cs: This is the class that represents a mathematical vector object.

  SparseMatrix.cs: This is the class that represents a sparse matrix object


For more information go to each individual class where there is more extensive documentation on what each function does.
